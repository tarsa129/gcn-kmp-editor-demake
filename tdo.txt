better ways to handle routes:
make camera types 1 and 2 a "route optional" camera
create routes for objects when switching ids
add check to see if people actually add at least two route points
do not auto ground for camera route points?
when placing an object with a routepoint, assign to closest routepoint

general fixes:
edit camera / area types boxes
keep track of variables for topdown and 3d modes individually

updates:
improve json files
error analyzer
came - camera viewing fixes + replay (all types of cameras)
render with scale
select linked for objects

new features:
handle boos automatically + handle that enemy point switching thing
add arrow keys for "next point" in route
load + collide on gobj collision files
add option to select x to y points
create dialog for auto generation and auto cleanup
